# Products Api Manager

I've developed his plugin in wordpress to manage products directly from the live api to check the products availablity in both website and api and missing products from website and sold out products in api.

> If you want to provide an api then the api format should be same as the test-api.sv in test-apis folder, The api must contains the follwing columns:
- [x] title 
- [x] description 
- [x] Product Category
- [x] Size
- [x] Quantity
- [x] price 
- [x] sale_price 
- [x] SKU 
- [x] color 
- [x] brand 
- [x] UPC
- [x] shipping_weight
- [x] shipping_height
- [x] shipping_length
- [x] shipping_width
- [x] image_link
